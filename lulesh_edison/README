All these runs were done with commit verision
f74a7c9a11cd6fea1b29e206731894b2a23de91f,
except for the probe_time runs which were based off a fork of develop
from commit 48e9ffe618798feaa854c6323143ae6eee646348.

halfcore is the same as isir_cf_pwc except I capped the number of
cores at 12 for hpx.

isir_cf_pwc are the main results of interest.

orig_pwc_results was the most up to date run before we started
measuring isir in addition to pwc.

probe_time is with some added code to measure the amount of time spent
in the local and remote probe for pwc.
